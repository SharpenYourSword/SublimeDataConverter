DataConverter 1.1.0
-------------------

This update removes the "delimiter" setting, which overlapped with the "dialects" setting.
If you wish to read a specific DSV syntax, the "use_dialect" setting allows you to set a specific dialect.

Changes
--------
* pretty-printed Python output
* output is now escaped
* better error handling
* Dummy variable no longer used in PHP and JS output
* Corrected HTML </thead> indentation
